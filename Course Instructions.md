**Introduction to Flopy**

This course provides a gentle introduction to Flopy. It is far from being a comprehensive course on all the intricacies and capacilities of the software. Rather, 
the course aims to provide the fundamental tools and knowledge to get you started. 

All exercises will employ MODFLOW 6 models. Although other MODFLOW variants are supported by Flopy, each has slightly different syntax. 
To keep things simple for the course, we will focsu on MOFLOW 6. Once the you are familiar with Flopy, it should not be too chalenging to apply the same principles to other MODFLOW variants.

**What will be covered:**
 - Installation
 - Basics of creating, running and displaying a very simple flow model
 - Setting up time-varying packages
 - Visualizing and post-processing model outputs.
 - A real-world case:
   - DISV grids and GRIDGEN
   - using external files during model construction (i.e. grid, BC locations, etc.)
   - the OBS package
   - loading and editing an existing model
   - adding a transport model
 - Some additional topics:
   - setting up the BUY package for density-coupled flow and transport
   - configuring multilayer wells with the MAW package

**Pre-requisites**
 - Basic understanding of Python 
 - Basic understanding of Jupyter Notebooks
 - Basic understanding of MODFLOW 6
 - Basic understanding of common GIS file formats

Familiarity with git would be a bonus, but not fundamental.

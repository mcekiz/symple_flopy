# Symple: Flopy
https://hydrosymple.com/en/

Notebooks and model files used during the Symple Flopy course.

These are a work in progress.

# Notebooks

 - **sgn-model-1layer**:<br>
 This version will be used during the lectures. I split it up into several notebooks to make each phase bite-sized and to take the oportunity to demonstrate how to load & edit existing models.
   - 01 constructs flow model
   - 02 adds transport model
   - 03 creates a new model to simulate the effect of the hydraulic barrier
 - **sgn-model-3layer**:
   - all three steps as per the 1layer model, all in the same notebook. This will probably be left as an example notebook, but not covered in the lectures. (fyi: takes a while to run the notebook).


# Data
